# [Assignment] #2 - Responsive Navigation

The student will recreate a fully responsive, one-page site based on the PSD provided. All assets are provided in the assets.zip file and/or the PSD. The completed site must demonstrate well-formed and structured HTML markup while writing clear and efficient CSS. The site will display the three different font types used in the PSD for all users and devices. The layout and styles will best match the PSD and adjust to different screen sizes using fluid and fixed layout techniques, and a media query. CSS properties used should have high global browser support (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) and the site will need to properly display on all screen widths starting at 320px wide.

Download the asset.zip file for the required SVG's and Photoshop composition. Download the accompanying marking guide.

## Build Suggestions
Use the following suggestions for creating your web page and css file:
* For the `Good Food` heading consider using a `<span>` tag for each word
* For _overlapping_ images consider using `position` styling
* The `<nav>` in the `<header>` is to be styled differently from the `<nav>` in the `<footer>`
* The _Stuff_ block:
  * Style the parent block
  * Each block has the same styling
  * Positionining of headings under the images is either positioning of the heading or the image background
* Fonts:
  * Put the font files in a `font` folder
  * Link to the appropriate google font
* All anchor tags will have `href="#"`

> **NOTE**: You are not required to add css code to tab through the sub-menus, but can if you have time.
