# [Assignment] #2 - Responsive Navigation

The student will recreate a fully responsive, one-page site based on the PSD provided. All assets are provided in the asset folder and/or the PSD. The completed site must demonstrate well-formed and structured HTML markup while writing clear and efficient CSS. The site will display the three different font types used in the PSD for all users and devices. The layout and styles will best match the PSD and adjust to different screen sizes using fluid and fixed layout techniques, and a media query. CSS properties used should have high global browser support (Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) and the site will need to properly display on all screen widths starting at 320px wide.

Download the asset's folder for the required SVG's and Photoshop composition. Download the accompanying marking guide.
